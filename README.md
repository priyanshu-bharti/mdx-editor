# Markdown Editor

Just a random experimental attempt of creating a frontend for a text editor. If this repo isn't archived yet, it probably means that the project is unfinished. 

## Why create this? 
I don't know, for funsies maybe? I have bigger this planned ahead of this one, composed of several moving pieces which will come together \[hopefully\] in a beautiful fashion to create a larger app.

### Don't contribute
If you just wanna use this as a starting point for any of your project, feel free to star this repo and come back to it whenever you desire. I won't be adding more features other than persistence and light/dark theming.
